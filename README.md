# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
The objective and goal of this project is to:

•	Take raw emails, pre-process the text data

•	Train a machine learning model that classifies it as either spam or non-spam

•	Test and evaluate the performance of our trained model

And that’s exactly what we have done. i hope this model can help anyone intersted in creating a spam dectector and the report can help them or new learners understand it better.
